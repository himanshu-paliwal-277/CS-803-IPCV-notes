## Q.2 Discuss backtracking algorithm by an example.

## Backtracking Algorithm

## Introduction

**Backtracking** is a **problem-solving algorithm** used for finding all possible solutions by **exploring all potential candidates**.  
If a candidate does not satisfy the conditions, the algorithm **abandons** it and **backtracks** to try another path.

It is commonly used in problems like puzzles, games, and combinatorial optimization.

---

## Key Points

- Backtracking builds the solution **step-by-step**.
- If a step does not lead to a solution, it **undoes** the step (backtracks) and tries another option.
- It is generally implemented using **recursion**.

---

## General Approach

1. Choose an option.
2. Explore further based on this choice.
3. If it leads to a solution, continue.
4. If not, **undo** the last choice (backtrack) and try another.

---

## Example: Solving the N-Queens Problem

**Problem Statement**:  
Place `N` queens on an `N×N` chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other (no same row, column, or diagonal).

---

### Steps:

1. Start from the first row.
2. Try placing a queen in each column of the row.
3. If safe, place the queen and move to the next row.
4. If not safe or no column is safe, backtrack to the previous row and move the queen.

---

### Pseudocode:

```text
solveNQueens(board, row):
    if row >= N:
        print board
        return
    for col = 0 to N-1:
        if isSafe(board, row, col):
            placeQueen(board, row, col)
            solveNQueens(board, row + 1)
            removeQueen(board, row, col)  // BACKTRACK
```

---

### Example: 4-Queens Problem

#### Board Setup (Initially):

```
. . . .
. . . .
. . . .
. . . .
```

#### Steps:

- Place queen at (0, 1)
- Place queen at (1, 3)
- Place queen at (2, 0)
- Place queen at (3, 2)

Result:

```

```

✅ No two queens attack each other.

---

## Applications of Backtracking

- Solving puzzles (like Sudoku, Maze problems)
- N-Queens problem
- Generating permutations and combinations
- Parsing and regular expression matching
- Graph coloring problems

---

## Conclusion

Backtracking is a **powerful** and **flexible** method for solving constraint satisfaction problems.  
It tries every possibility and **backtracks** whenever a choice leads to a dead-end, making it a useful strategy in many computational fields.

## Q.3 Compare weak perspective projection and orthographic projection models in affine projection models.

## Comparison of Weak Perspective Projection and Orthographic Projection Models

## Introduction

In computer vision and image processing, **Affine Projection Models** simplify the complex **perspective projection** to make mathematical calculations easier.  
Two common types of affine projection models are:

- **Weak Perspective Projection**
- **Orthographic Projection**

---

## 1. Orthographic Projection Model

- Simplest form of projection.
- Assumes that the depth (z-coordinate) **does not affect** the x and y positions.
- **All projection lines are parallel** to each other and perpendicular to the image plane.
- The size of the object remains **constant**, regardless of its distance from the camera.

### Mathematical Representation:

If `(X, Y, Z)` is a 3D point,  
then its 2D projection `(x, y)` is:

```text
x = X
y = Y
```

(No division by Z coordinate.)

---

## 2. Weak Perspective Projection Model

- A slightly more accurate approximation compared to orthographic.
- Assumes that the object is relatively **flat** and **small compared to the distance** from the camera.
- All 3D points are projected using an **average depth (Z₀)**.
- **Uniform scaling** is applied based on the average depth.

### Mathematical Representation:

If `(X, Y, Z)` is a 3D point and `Z₀` is the average depth,  
then the 2D projection `(x, y)` is:

```text
x = (f / Z₀) * X
y = (f / Z₀) * Y
```

Where `f` = focal length of the camera.

---

## Key Differences

| Feature           | Orthographic Projection                       | Weak Perspective Projection                             |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Assumption        | Object is very far from the camera            | Object is small relative to distance                    |
| Depth Information | Completely ignored                            | Approximate depth considered (average Z₀)               |
| Lines             | Parallel and perpendicular to the image plane | Parallel, but includes scaling based on Z₀              |
| Scale Variation   | No scaling with depth                         | Uniform scaling with average depth                      |
| Accuracy          | Less accurate for close objects               | More accurate for objects with moderate depth variation |
| Complexity        | Simpler                                       | Slightly more complex                                   |

---

## Conclusion

Both **orthographic** and **weak perspective** projections are useful approximations of real-world perspective projection, especially when the depth variations are small.

- **Orthographic projection** is used for extremely simple and distant objects.
- **Weak perspective projection** offers a better approximation when small depth variations cannot be completely ignored.

## Q.4 Explain in brief how photogrammetric processing is done from 2D to 3D.

## Photogrammetric Processing from 2D to 3D

## Introduction

**Photogrammetry** is the science of making **measurements** from photographs, especially for recovering the **exact positions** of surface points.  
It is mainly used to create **3D models** from **2D images**.

---

## Steps for Photogrammetric Processing (2D to 3D)

### 1. Image Acquisition

- Capture multiple **overlapping 2D images** of the object or scene from different angles.
- High-quality images increase the accuracy of the 3D model.

---

### 2. Camera Calibration

- Estimate the **intrinsic parameters** (focal length, principal point, lens distortion).
- Calibration helps correct image distortions and understand the camera geometry.

---

### 3. Feature Detection and Matching

- Identify common **key points** (features) across multiple images.
- Techniques like **SIFT**, **SURF**, or **ORB** are used for feature detection.
- Match the corresponding points between images.

---

### 4. Structure from Motion (SfM)

- Recover **camera positions** and **3D structure** simultaneously from the matched features.
- Generates a **sparse 3D point cloud** (basic 3D representation).

---

### 5. Multi-View Stereo (MVS)

- Use multiple images to **densify** the sparse point cloud.
- Produces a **dense 3D point cloud** with fine details.

---

### 6. 3D Model Generation

- Convert the dense point cloud into a **mesh** by connecting points into triangles (surface creation).
- Apply **texture mapping** using the original photographs for realistic appearance.

---

### 7. Final Refinements

- Apply **smoothing**, **noise removal**, and **editing** to improve the 3D model quality.
- Export the final model in suitable formats like `.obj`, `.ply`, etc.

---

## Conclusion

Photogrammetric processing allows the transformation of **2D images into accurate 3D models** by combining image analysis, geometry, and computational algorithms.  
It is widely used in fields like **architecture**, **surveying**, **heritage conservation**, **geography**, and **virtual reality**.

## Q.5 What is image intensity in image processing & Discuss in be the intensity matching of 1D signals in an image.

## Image Intensity and Intensity Matching of 1D Signals

## What is Image Intensity?

- **Image Intensity** refers to the **brightness level** of a pixel in a grayscale image.
- It represents the **amount of light** or **energy** captured by the sensor for that pixel.
- Intensity values are usually:
  - **0** (black) to **255** (white) for an 8-bit image.
  - Higher intensity → **brighter** pixel.
  - Lower intensity → **darker** pixel.

### Example:

- Intensity = 0 → Black
- Intensity = 128 → Gray
- Intensity = 255 → White

---

## Intensity Matching of 1D Signals in an Image

- A **1D signal** in an image refers to the variation of **intensity values along a single line** (either horizontal, vertical, or diagonal).
- **Intensity Matching** means **comparing** or **aligning** the intensity values of two 1D signals to find **similarity** or **correspondence**.

---

### Steps of Intensity Matching:

1. **Extract 1D Signals**

   - Select a line (row or column) from the image.
   - Get the intensity values along that line.

2. **Normalize the Signals**

   - Scale the intensity values if required (for fair comparison).

3. **Compute Matching/Similarity**

   - Use similarity measures like:
     - **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
     - **Cross-correlation**
     - **Normalized Cross-correlation**

4. **Find Best Match**
   - The position where the similarity measure is maximum indicates the **best match** between signals.

---

### Applications:

- **Template Matching** in images.
- **Motion Estimation** in video sequences.
- **Stereo Vision** to find corresponding points between left and right images.

---

## Conclusion

Image intensity is the basic building block representing the brightness of pixels, and intensity matching of 1D signals helps in identifying similarities, motion, or depth information within or between images.
