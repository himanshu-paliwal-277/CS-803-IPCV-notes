## Q.6 What is Thresholding? Discuss its use and also write its limitations.

## Thresholding in Digital Image Processing

## What is Thresholding?

**Thresholding** is a simple and effective technique in digital image processing used to **segment** an image into **foreground** and **background**.

- It works by selecting a **threshold value (T)** and then classifying each pixel as:
  - **Foreground** if the pixel value > T
  - **Background** if the pixel value ≤ T

Thus, thresholding converts a **grayscale image** into a **binary image**.

---

## Mathematical Representation

For a pixel at coordinate (x, y) with intensity value f(x, y):

\[
g(x, y) =
\begin{cases}
1, & \text{if } f(x, y) > T \\
0, & \text{if } f(x, y) \leq T
\end{cases}
\]

Where:
- \( g(x, y) \) is the output binary image.
- \( T \) is the threshold value.

---

## Uses of Thresholding

1. **Image Segmentation**
   - Separates objects from the background for easier analysis.

2. **Object Detection**
   - Helps in detecting specific regions of interest in an image.

3. **Preprocessing Step**
   - Used before applying operations like edge detection, shape analysis, and OCR (Optical Character Recognition).

4. **Medical Imaging**
   - Used to separate different tissues or tumors from MRI, CT, or X-ray images.

5. **Document Image Analysis**
   - Converts scanned text documents into binary images for character recognition.

---

## Types of Thresholding

- **Global Thresholding**: Single threshold value applied to the entire image.
- **Adaptive Thresholding**: Different threshold values used for different regions of the image.
- **Otsu’s Method**: Automatically calculates the optimal threshold by minimizing intra-class variance.

---

## Limitations of Thresholding

1. **Sensitive to Lighting Conditions**
   - Changes in illumination can affect the result, making thresholding unreliable in non-uniform lighting.

2. **Not Suitable for Complex Images**
   - Works poorly if the object and background have overlapping intensity ranges.

3. **Noise Sensitivity**
   - Thresholding can misclassify noise pixels as object pixels, leading to errors.

4. **Fixed Threshold Problems**
   - A single threshold value may not work well across the entire image, especially in images with varying brightness.

5. **Loss of Information**
   - Converts rich grayscale information into two levels (black and white), losing important details.

---

## Conclusion

**Thresholding** is a fundamental technique in image processing for **image segmentation**.  
While it is **simple**, **fast**, and **easy to implement**, it has **limitations** especially in complex, noisy, or non-uniformly lit images.  
For such cases, more advanced techniques like **adaptive thresholding** or **machine learning-based segmentation** may be preferred.

---

## Q.7 Explain global & adaptive thresholding techniques.

## Global and Adaptive Thresholding Techniques

## 1. Global Thresholding

### Definition:
Global Thresholding is a technique where **a single constant threshold value (T)** is chosen for the entire image to separate foreground and background pixels.

- Pixels with intensity **greater than T** are classified as **foreground (object)**.
- Pixels with intensity **less than or equal to T** are classified as **background**.

---

### Mathematical Expression:

For a pixel at (x, y) with intensity f(x, y):

\[
g(x, y) =
\begin{cases}
1, & \text{if } f(x, y) > T \\
0, & \text{if } f(x, y) \leq T
\end{cases}
\]

Where:
- \( g(x, y) \) is the output binary image.

---

### Applications:
- Simple document image binarization (e.g., converting a scanned paper into black and white).
- Situations where lighting is **uniform** across the image.

---

### Limitations:
- Fails in images with **non-uniform illumination**.
- Cannot handle images with **varying contrast** across different regions.

---

## 2. Adaptive Thresholding

### Definition:
Adaptive Thresholding calculates **different threshold values** for different regions of the image based on local properties like mean or median intensity.

- It divides the image into **small regions** (blocks) and computes a **local threshold** for each block.
- Each pixel is compared with its local threshold.

---

### Working Principle:
Instead of using a single threshold (T), adaptive thresholding uses a threshold function \( T(x, y) \) that varies across the image.

\[
g(x, y) =
\begin{cases}
1, & \text{if } f(x, y) > T(x, y) \\
0, & \text{if } f(x, y) \leq T(x, y)
\end{cases}
\]

---

### Methods of Adaptive Thresholding:
- **Mean Adaptive Thresholding**: Local threshold is the mean intensity of neighborhood pixels.
- **Gaussian Adaptive Thresholding**: Local threshold is a weighted sum (Gaussian distribution) of neighborhood pixels.

---

### Applications:
- Useful for images with **shadows**, **gradients**, or **uneven lighting**.
- Common in **fingerprint recognition**, **license plate detection**, and **medical image analysis**.

---

### Advantages:
- More **robust** against non-uniform lighting conditions.
- **Better performance** in complex images with varying intensities.

---

### Limitations:
- **Computationally more expensive** compared to global thresholding.
- **Noise** in small regions can affect local threshold calculations.

---

## Conclusion

| Aspect                  | Global Thresholding               | Adaptive Thresholding            |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Threshold Type           | Single, constant                  | Varies locally                  |
| Best for                 | Uniform lighting                  | Non-uniform lighting             |
| Computation Speed        | Fast                               | Slower                          |
| Robustness               | Low for complex images            | High for complex images         |

Thus, while **global thresholding** is suitable for simple, uniformly lit images, **adaptive thresholding** is preferred for complex, real-world images where lighting and contrast vary.

|
|           _______
|          |       |
|__________|       |_________
|
+----------------------> Distance
```

- Two edges form a **bright or dark region** representing a line.

---

## Key Differences

| Feature              | Edge                                | Line                                |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Definition           | Boundary between two regions       | Narrow strip with distinct intensity |
| Appearance           | Sudden intensity change             | Constant intensity across a width    |
| Detection Tools      | Edge detectors (Sobel, Canny, etc.) | Line detectors (Hough Transform)     |
| Structure            | Single boundary                    | Two boundaries enclosing a region   |

---

## Conclusion
